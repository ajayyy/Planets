# Planets

This is multiplayer planet-based game. There are planets, circles with a gravitational pull, that pull all players towards them. When a player collides with the planet, they bounce off. You can press W and A to move left and right relative to the normal of the planet position you are currently in. You can also click on-screen to launch a projectile. Launched projectile will fly in the direction you point and also get pulled in by gravity, but they will not bounce off the planet. When you launch a projectile, you get pushed in the other direction (equal and opposite force). The is another way to move. When a projectile collides with a player, they bounce off of each other, allowing one player to launch a projectile at another player to push them around.

# How to build

Clone this repo into a folder inside of an Eclipse workspace. Setup might be slightly different in other IDEs.

### Pre-download setup

To use WebGL export, you must install the GWT plugin in eclipse. Make sure to do this before going to the next step. If you don't plan on exporting to WebGL, you don't have to install this.

The Android SDK is needed to run this project.

### Setup

Create a file called `local.properties` in the main directory following the format of `local.properties.example`. Make sure to put in the path to your Android SDK.

Open the `Planets` folder as a gradle project.

`File -> Import -> Gradle Project`

If using the WebGL project, go to `Properties -> GWT -> Web Application` and uncheck the box that says `This project has a WAR directory` for the `Planets-HTML` project.

### Running the software

To run the server, run `Server.java`. To run the client on desktop, run `DesktopLauncher.java`.

# Technology Stack

This is written in Java with the library Lib-GDX. Lib-GDX is an open-source library that wraps LWJGL function and allows you to export you Java game into many more platforms such as even HTML5/WebGL. LWJGL is a library that is adds Java functions for OpenGL calls.

The networking is handled with a library called Java-WebSockets (https://github.com/TooTallNate/Java-WebSocket). Websockets are used since they are the only network type supported in JavaScript, which I am planning on porting this to later (with Lib-GDXâ€™s WebGL export).
